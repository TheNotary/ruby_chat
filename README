Here's an example of how to setup a basic ruby chatroom.  It really only works between 2 people in it's current state, and requires a different approach to add more members (for security reasons).  


1)  Start the Faye server  `ruby faye_server.rb`

2)  Start a web server in the public directory `cd public;python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

3)  Open an admin... localhost:8000/admin_chat_interface.html in a web browser to act as admin

4)  Open a client... localhost:8000/admin_chat_interface.html in web browser, and click the 'Become CLient' button.  

The two web pages can now chat with each other using the online interface.  Note that they're relying on communications over port 10614.
